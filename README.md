# Quantus.Sitecore
The library provides basic integration of [Quantus](https://github.com/bartlomiejmucha/Quantus) library for Sitecore. 

## Installation

Nuget package is available: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Quantus.Sitecore

## Example implementations

I don't want to force the way one can use that library. That's why helper methods are not included in Quantus.Sitecore assembly. I'm going to change that when I or the community figure out the best way to implement it. However there are example implementations for Sitecore Dictionary and Habitat Dictionary:
* For Sitecore Dictionary example look at my [blog](http://bartlomiejmucha.com/en/blog/quantus-the-library-to-handle-plurals-of-nouns-for-sitecore-dictionary-and-habitat-dictionary),
* For Habitat Dictionary example look at this [pull request](https://github.com/Sitecore/Habitat/pull/353)
